I. PROJECT'S TITLE

DM4 ML

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The code is written with Python on different Jupyter Notebook
The libraries used :
import time
import io
import numpy as np
import hiive.mdptoolbox
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from hiive.mdptoolbox import mdp, example
from gym.envs.toy_text.frozen_lake import generate_random_map

The goal is to test different algorithms (model-based : Value Iteration and Policy Iteration and model free : Q-learning) on 2 different problems with different size to see the performance and the differences between each of them.

First part : Random Forest
1. Value Iteration
2. Policy Iteration
3. Q-learning

Second part : Frozen Lake
1. Value Iteration
2. Policy Iteration
3. Q-learning

III. HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN THE PROJECT

1. Download Anaconda-Navigator
2. Use a Jupyter Notebook or whatever software which uses python
3. Import all the libraries
4. Run all the different codes in the GitHub
